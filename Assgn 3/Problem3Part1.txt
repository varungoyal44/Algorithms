Problem 3 Part 1:
findings:

the KNAP-IND-REC algo only provides us with the best cost 
and not the set of items that should be stolen!
Also it takes exponential time, thus the program "virtually"
hangs when a list of only 50 items is provided to it.

On the other hand KNAPSACK-INDIVISIBLE gives us the best cost very
quickly. O(n.W)
